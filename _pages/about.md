Hello! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Allison M. Okamura in the [CHARM Lab](https://charm.stanford.edu/). I was supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship for my first three years. My research focuses on computational modeling of soft materials and entangled structures, as well as design optimization. In particular, I have been working on the modeling and design optimization of knitted textiles. Please see my CV and portfolio for more information.

I received my Bachelor of Science degree (Valedictorian, Summa Cum Laude) in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (Mechanical Engineering major) at Seoul National University, with a minor in Statistics. I was supported by the Presidential Science Scholarship and the WINNS (Women in eNgineering Network at SNU) Fellowship.
