Wang, Y., An, J., Kim, H., Jeong, S., Kim, H., Park, J., Ko, S., Son, J,. Lee, H. Printing Mosaics of Magnetically Programmed Liquid Crystal Directors for Reversibly Morphing Soft Matter. arXiv:2401.06590.

- Developed and demonstrated diverse shape-morphing prototypes by directly integrating magnetic-field aligned LCE actuation into kirigami, buckling, and complex 3D structures, validated through FEA simulations.
