Darwin, E.C., Jeong, S., Sim, J., Kuhl, E. "Discovering the Mechanics of Skin: Transversely Isotropic Biological Models for Tissue"

- Developed constitutive artificial neural network (CANN) models to characterize the nonlinear, anisotropic mechanical behavior of skin, achieving improved accuracy over traditional constitutive models.
